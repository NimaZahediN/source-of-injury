Then I lifted the next box which was a box of 48 pieces of butter off a pallet to put into the cart to take to the display cooler. When I went to lift the box of butter onto the cart, I felt something click in my back and started to be painful. I stood up from bent over position and I was very sore when I turned around to the left. I went to my manager & he sent me home at about 10:40 a.m. That day I thought it would go away but the next day I was having pain down into my arms. I called my doctor and they were closed.  \"\n",
