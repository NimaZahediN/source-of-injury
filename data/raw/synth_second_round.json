Despite implementing health checks and distancing measures, I developed symptoms indicative of a viral infection, such as sore throat and chills.",
            "Chain of Thought": "International events, especially sports tournaments, present opportunities for viral transmission due to diverse participants and high mobility. The interaction with teams from outbreak regions and the symptom alignment with known viral infections support the inference of viral exposure through direct contact and shared facilities.",

Despite ensuring ample sanitation stations and encouraging distancing, I later developed flu-like symptoms. The event attracted a large crowd, with attendees from various regions.",
            "Chain of Thought": "Large gatherings such as concerts, especially those with attendees from multiple regions, increase the risk of viral spread. The rapid onset of symptoms following the event and the nature of crowd interactions suggest that the virus was contracted through airborne or direct contact transmission, typical of mass events.",
